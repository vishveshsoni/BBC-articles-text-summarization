      "Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.\n",
      "Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King.\n",
      "This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.\n",
      "However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted.\n",
      "The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.\n",
      "\"It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,\" she said.\n",
      "\"We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,\" said Ms Capella.\n",
      "This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus.\n",
      "Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult.\n",
      "\"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,\" said Ms Capella.\n",
      "\"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.\"\n",
      "Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.\n",
      "Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave.\n",
      "\"We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,\" said Mr Seagrave.\n",
